## Introduction

This repository is intended to be a How To for new developers to KBase, that walks them through the
background information necessary to be a confident and productive contributor to the KBase project.
This intended to be a living document - if you have updates or extensions, please fork it and the submit
a pull request.

## Architecture

blah blah blah

## Core Services

wahwah wahwah wahwah

## A Local Development Environment

The core dependency for working on KBase projects is the ability to run docker containers in your local environment.

## Docker and MacOS

MacOS developers the recommended setup is to use [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/),
this bundles up all the dependencies for running a Docker environment into a single installer. We recommend using
the "stable" version.

## Docker and Linux

[Most current releases of Linux Distros either include Docker or allow it to be installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/) provided that you have administrative privileges.

### Redhat Based Distros

https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/rhel/

### Ubuntu Based Distros

## KBase SDK

The KBase SDK is fairly well documented in the (README document in Github)[https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk]
In addition, Mike Sneddon has a [detailed architecture slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18hxRC5enjA6kF-Ezn9xWdZ5xr2tg2c6LxBQXPxQ_5ik/edit?usp=sharing) that provides an overview of the SDK architecture.

## An SDK App

wakka wakka wakka

## Modifying the SDK

made ya look!

## Workspace

running out of nonsense sayings

## Narrative

okay, that's all I had
